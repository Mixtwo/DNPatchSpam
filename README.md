# DNPatchSpam
Iterates through a series of character string to find hidden patches from http://dragonnest.nexon.net/news/all/

--- How it works ---
1) Input the last 3 characters of the most recent public patch URL.
2) Algorithm iterates in increasing order.
3) Check if Http connection responds with status code 404 or 200.
4) Returns URL with successful Http request code 200.

--- Update ---
